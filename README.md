# Packet Sniffer for GZIP Decompression and Form Data Extraction üêçüîç

This Python script is designed to monitor and analyze network traffic, specifically focusing on GZIP compression in HTTP responses and extracting form data (username and password) from HTTP POST requests.

## Features ‚ú®

- **GZIP Decompression**: Automatically detects and decompresses GZIP-encoded data in HTTP responses.
- **Form Data Extraction**: Captures form data (such as usernames and passwords) from HTTP POST requests.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Uses Scapy and NetfilterQueue to monitor packets in real-time.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `scapy`
- `netfilterqueue`
- `zlib`
- `urllib.parse`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

CODICE
pip install scapy netfilterqueue
CODICE

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The script requires **root privileges** to capture network traffic.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **GZIP Detection**: The script scans HTTP packets for the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header. When it detects this header, it decompresses the corresponding GZIP-encoded data.
2. **Form Data Extraction**: When a POST request is detected, the script attempts to extract form data (specifically `username` and `password`) from the HTTP body.
3. **Packet Monitoring**: The script uses NetfilterQueue to capture and inspect network packets in real-time.

## Usage üöÄ

1. Make sure you have **root privileges**, as this script needs to capture packets on the network.
2. Run the script:

CODICE
sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py
CODICE

3. The script will start monitoring packets and will display:

   - Detected **GZIP-encoded data** in HTTP responses.
   - Extracted **form data (username and password)** from HTTP POST requests.

4. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script.

## Example Output üìä

- **GZIP Detected**: The script will print a message when it detects GZIP-encoded data.

    CODICE
    Dati GZIP rilevati nella risposta.
    CODICE

- **Form Data Extracted**: If form data is successfully extracted, it will display the username and password.

    CODICE
    Form trovato: Username:  ['user123']  Password:  ['password456']
    CODICE
